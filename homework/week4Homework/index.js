/*GOAL: Create a website that informs a visitor about something. The website should be readable and look nice: the website's basic appearance matters more than the particular content.

You could create the beginnings of a professional portfolio website highlighting your career path and skills, or you could create a website that simply displays information about something you are interested in.*/
